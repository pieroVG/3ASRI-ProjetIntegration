This model comes in two versions 'Not-equipped' and 'Equipped'. The 
equipped version has reduced motion range to account for restrictions
from extra hardware and cables routed outside of the robot.

Also note that the 'Equipped' version has a reduce payload of 150 kg
and lower allowable moment of inertia for the wrist joints. Please 
refer to the manual YASKAWA MOTOMAN-GP165R,GP200R INSTRUCTIONS
